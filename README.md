<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About apk2theme

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)


apk2theme was created to help aid in converting Android Icon Packs over to iPhone without having to spend hours sifting through image files, finding the right ones, and renaming them to match different naming conventions. With apk2theme, you can simply drag and drop an APK file onto the compiled binary and you'll have a fully-working (iOS 11+) compatible iPhone theme.



#### Features:
* Online icon database (if found, it will read a local icons.txt file; if not, it will fallback to an online list)
* APK validity check (make sure that the given file is a real APK)
* Automatic icon extraction and conversion (only extracting the icon resources, and nothing else)
* Installation-ready themes (the themes created are fully ready to be used on any jailbroken device)

Please keep in mind that this project is still in development; if you find any bugs, please submit them using the link above.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Using apk2theme

apk2theme was built to be simple. Simply drag and drop an Android APK file onto apk2theme to begin the conversion process. You can also drag and drop multiple APK files to batch convert themes.

If you have your own custom icon filter list, place it in the same directory as apk2theme with the name **icons.txt**. If this file is not found when apk2theme runs, it will fall back to an online icon list hosted on my web server.
